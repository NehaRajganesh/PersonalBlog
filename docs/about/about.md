I'm a Statistics major at Texas A&M University with a minor in Computer Science. I’m passionate about using data to drive strategy, uncover insights, and create scalable solutions. My background includes applied machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization across a range of industries.

At STgenetics, I work as a Data Science Intern focused on analyzing global payroll systems, uncovering drivers of employee turnover, and supporting long-term planning through clear, data-driven reporting. Previously, I built machine learning models to improve operational efficiency and led technical workshops through the Aggie Data Science Club.

I'm especially excited about the power of AI to reshape how we build products, solve problems, and make smarter decisions. I’m drawn to roles that blend data science with product thinking to create real-world impact.

Outside of data, I enjoy creative leadership, whether that’s choreographing for my competitive dance team or launching student-led initiatives.
